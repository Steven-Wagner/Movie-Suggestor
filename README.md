## Movie Suggester

Live page: https://movie-suggester.stevenwagner.now.sh

### Description:

Get movie suggestions from people who like similar movies as you.

The inspiration for this app comes from studies that show that the best way to determine if an individual will like a new movie is to see whether their friends enjoyed it. Most current movie review sites take the average of all users or critics and try to predict the quality of the movie and the likelihood that someone will enjoy the movie, but people's tastes are eclectic and having an algorithm that is more personalized to the user will result in a better prediction of what each individual user will enjoy. The goal of this app is to connect users with similar tastes so that they can receive personalized movie suggestions that will be more accurate than a traditional movie review site at determining if that user will actually enjoy the movie.

## Features:

Movie Suggestor allows you to follow people that have similar movie intrests and gives you movie suggestions based on the friends you follow.
